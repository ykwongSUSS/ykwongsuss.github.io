  <h1>Learning R on Github Pages</h1>
  <p>These pages are written in html from the RStudio editor. They are saved under Github Desktop and then committed to Github at ykwongsuss.github.io</p>
  
  <p>This file is saved as index.html and may be 
  updated using the usual commit and push.</p>
  
  <p>All html files are one the same level (for now). I intend to use this for the R-LessonPlan-0x series.</p>
